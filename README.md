Eve programming language, method and technology and medium.

Abstract
---------------------------

Eve is a new more efficient method of communication between 
human-machine (HtoM), machine-machine (MtoM) ,human-human (HtoH). 

Eve is a medium of human and machine communication that represents language and emotion 
through the inscription or recording of computer and physical objects and linking them together.

With eve ,we can eliminate the barrier between human and machine, virtual and physical world. 

With eve, we can make algorithms without too much prior knowledge. 

Introduction
---------------------------

First problem (1stP)
==============

Communication: 
Digital age brought electronic devices to our everyday life, however communication with electronic machines is 
a challenging task for a person who does not familiar with electronic machines. The current methods are based 
on techniques brought from other industries which is not perfectly suitable solving this problem.

Second problem (2thP)
==============

Writing algorithms is almost exclusively a privilege of a computer programmer. The everyday people have no such 
method for making algorithms in electronic systems in a easy way.

Third problem (3thP)
==============

There is a barrier between physical world and electronic systems when we try to incorporate physical objects 
and ideas into electronic systems.

Machines have do not have a comparative or similar quality communication way to a human being.

//////////

In my opinion this difficulties does not exist because the lack of education and effort.
The current technologies not effective

Equipment and Methodology
---------------------------

Linux, mainly Fedora.

Results AND Discussion
---------------------------

Had good result on some early test.

Conclusions
---------------------------

Eve confirmed its effectiveness. Developement is in planned ,early stage, only done 
by myself (Gellert Kis) solely. Because of this state, the project is approaching slowly. 

The slow Developement Methodology brought a few changes to the core concept. 

These core concepts are crucial. Because of these, the project can fail later when enormous work 
already invested. I avoided these pitfalls.
